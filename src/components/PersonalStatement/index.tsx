            I am a passionate full stack web and mobile developer with 4+ years
            of experience and a Master&apos;s in Applied Computer Science. I
            have experience with emerging technologies/practices like GraphQL,

            Asynchronous design, Design Patterns, Docker, Lazy loading, NextJS

            I believe in not sticking to one language and love exploring PHP,
            NextJS, React, C, C++, Flutter, Python Flask, Java Spring, Android
            Kotlin/Java, Apple Swift, Ruby. I am able to adapt to changes in the
            development workflow/languages/frameworks as it is a critical and
            scalable skill.

            I believe team work is critical for success and am able to work well
            with individuals with a broad range of traits. I am able to deduce
            business decisions and solutions rapidly and independently. I
            believe an eager-to-learn attitude is the only way forward and that
            drives me.
